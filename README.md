[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tobnys/Imperium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tobnys/Imperium)

Imperium is a web based idle game built with JavaScript, Node & other technologies.

In Imperium players can build their own fictional empire. The game is heavily based around economics as it is a so called "idle game".

## Summary
This application was made as a project for Thinkful's "Node Capstone project" and I put my mind to it and decided to make some sort of game. I definitely did some mistakes while scoping up the application, there was a lot of things that I did not think about

Bottom line is, I have been learning a lot through this whole project and it can only get better from here!

## Technology used

**Front-end**
 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * JavaScript
 * jQuery 
 
**Back-end**
 * NodeJS
 * Custom crafted API
 * Mongoose / MongoDB
 * Heroku (hosting)

**Testing**
 * Mocha & Chai
 * TravisCI

## UX
Design was not my main priority during this project, I wanted to focus on the functional bits and as of that, design was not important until the last few days of the project timeline. I feel like the design of the app is mediocre and could definitely be improved but then again my focus within this project was mainly within the functionality of the application.
