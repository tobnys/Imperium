# Imperium
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tobnys/Imperium.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tobnys/Imperium)

Imperium is a web based idle game built with JavaScript, Node & other technologies.

In Imperium players can build their own fictional empire. The game is heavily based around economics as it is a so called "idle game".

## Summary
This application was made as a project for Thinkful's "Node Capstone project" and I put my mind to it and decided to make some sort of game. I definitely did some mistakes while scoping up the application, there was a lot of things that I did not think about.

The game is essentially a so called "idle game" which means that the player does something which then can be automated so the player then can "idle" away from the game and check back later. That is the case here where a player can set up their economy to generate revenue and then later buy different crates for example.

Bottom line is, I have been learning a lot through this whole project and it can only get better from here!

## UX
Design was not my main priority during this project, I wanted to focus on the functional bits and as of that, design was not important until the last few days of the project timeline. I feel like the design of the app is mediocre and could definitely be improved but then again my focus within this project was mainly within the functionality of the application.
